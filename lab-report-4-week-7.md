## __Part2__ : Questions

First Style : 40 seconds

Second Style : 36 seconds

Q1) Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?

- I would prefer working with the "Second Style", if I am running remotely. It is more efficient to use the "Second Style" because I can save key strokes comparing with the "First Style". For example, if I use the "First Style", I would be using `scp` command and changing the server between local and remote a lot. By using the "Second Style", I don't need to use the `scp` command and change my server between local and remote.

Q2) What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another?

- If the project could be worked in the local server, I will prefer the "First Style". Right now, I feel confidence writing and editing codes based on my keyboard settings. I still need to get used to using the "Second Style".

- However, if the program should be worked on the remote machine, then I will pick the "Second Style" because it will be more convenient working on the remote machine. Also, if I get used to the "Second Style", I will use the "Second Style". Since, it saves key strokes compared to the "First Style".
