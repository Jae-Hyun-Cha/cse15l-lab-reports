## __Part2__ : Questions

First Style : 40 seconds
Second Style : 36 seconds

Q1) Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?

- I would prefer working with the "Second Style", if I am running remotely. It is more efficient to use the "Second Style" because I can save key strokes comparing with the "First Style". For example, using `scp` command and changing the server between local and remote.

Q2) What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another?

- If the project could be worked in the local server, I will prefer the "First Style". I feel confidence writing and editing codes based on my keyboard settings.
- However, if the program should be worked on the remote machine, then I will pick the "Second Style" because it will be more convenient working on the remote machine.
