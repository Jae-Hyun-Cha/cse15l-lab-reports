# __Tutorial__

Hello, everyone! This will be a tutorial for you to learn how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. I hope this tutorial will help you!

 1. __Installing VScode__

     We need to install Visual Studio Code. You can download it from this website link. Be sure to download the right version for you operating system (Windows, OS, etc). [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    - If you finish the download and open Visual Studio Code, it will look somewhat like the picture below. (Colors might be different!)

2. __Remotely Connecting__

    Setting up the course specific account
    - If you are a Windows user, you should download OpenSSH (Follow the link!) [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui)
    - Only download the OpenSSH __client__. Do not download the server.
    - For the first step, type the command in your terminal and type in your password.
    ``` 
     $ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu 
    ```
    - If you can't connect this account, you can use your own account!
    ``` 
     $ ssh <Your-UCSDgmail-ID>@ieng6.ucsd.edu 
    ```

    -  If the terminal shows you, "The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't...", type yes.


3. __Trying Some Commands__

    Now, let's try some commands!
    
    First, try to work with these commands. `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `cp`

    Now, try to work with these commands too! 

    - `cd ~`
    - `cd`
    - `ls -lat`
    - `ls -a`
    - `ls <directory>` where <directory> is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/cs15lfa22abc, where the abc is one of the other group membersâ€™ username
    - `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt ~/`
    - `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt`

    For logging out from the remote server in your terminal, you can try: command "exit" or press Ctrl + D

4. __Moving Files with scp__

    - 
5. __Setting an SSH Key__
    - If you're a Windows user, follow the instructions for ssh-add under "User key generation". [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation)

    ![Image](Window.png)

    - In the terminal, type in "ssh-keygen" to create a public and private SSH keys. You copy the public key to a particular location on the server, and the private key in a particular location on the client. Then, the ssh command can use the pair of files in place of your password.

    Here is the Screenshot that how it will look!
